# Insurance-LDA
In this project, I have attempted to create a Linear Regression Model. I am implementing it using sklearn which is the most common machine learning library.

#Libraries used in this project
I have installed Anaconda for this project. It has most of the libraries installed hence making work easier. The libraries i have used are;
Numpy – It provides a fast numerical array structure and operating functions.

• pandas – It provides tools for data storage, manipulation and analysis tasks.

• Scikit-Learn – The required machine learning library in Python.

• Matplotlib – It is the basic plotting library in Python. It provides tools for making plots.
