# Insurance-LDA
In this project, I have attempted to create a Linear Regression Model. I am implementing it using sklearn which is the most common machine learning library.

#Libraries used in this project
I have installed Anaconda for this project. It has most of the libraries installed hence making work easier. The libraries i have used are;
-pandas to enable data manipulation and storage
-numpy to provide functions to operate.
-matplotlib ro provide plotting tools.
-NumpyIt provides a fast numerical array structure and operating functions.
-seaborn sns to show the heatmap

#1.Loading the data
I loaded my data using dataset.pd_csv(). I proceeded to check the first and last data values using dataset.head() and dataset.tail() functions respectively.

#2. Checking for duplicated data
I used the function dataset.duplicated() to see if there is any data duplicated. i found that there was no duplicate values in my data.

#3. Describing data
To check the mean, standard deviation, etc I used the function dataset.describe()

#4. Creating a heatmap.
For this, I used seaborn sns to create a heatmap for my data.
